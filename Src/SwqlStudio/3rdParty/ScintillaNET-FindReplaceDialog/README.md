# ScintillaNET-FindReplaceDialog
A ScintillaNET v3 Find &amp; Replace Dialog + Goto Dialog + Incremental Search


Since there is no nuget package, I had to copy the code from https://github.com/Stumpii/ScintillaNET-FindReplaceDialog.

There is no apparent active development undergoing, so we're probably not losing anything with "static linking".
